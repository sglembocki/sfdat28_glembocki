#Overview:

The scope of this project is predicting 'Failure Modes' for Field Warranty Claims. Ideally, this will be completely automated to allow Engineers to better aggregate and solve issues that are occurring both in the Field and in the Factory. At minimum, this could serve as a tool to limit the choice of options (currently in the thousands) for Service Technicians to assign at the time of service. Currently these are assigned by Engineers which is not scalable with the current bandwidth and ramp rate.

#Dataset:

There is a plethora of data from Service Centers all over the world. Currently, it is known that the Null Accuracy is ~8.8%. The features that will be used to predict the Failure Mode include:

    - RollupSymptom (multiple choice)
    - Complaint Narrative (free text)
    - CauseDescription (multiple choice)
    - CauseNarrative (free text)
    - CorrectionDescription (multiple choice)
    - CorrectionNarrative (free text)
    - FaultMode (multiple choice) *
    
* Prediction field

The .csv file was generated from a SQL query. It is known that there are many NULL values and the text could use some cleaning (i.e. special characters, spelling errors, other languages, etc.).

#Progress to date:

Currently, a Naive Bayes model has been developed that produced an accuracy of ~34% (see Python notebook for code). Future edits include the following:

    - All lowercase
    - Exclude special characters
    - Try all feature combos
    - Exclude all words that are not English
    - Try different ngrams
    - Try different models and compare
    - Bring in car alerts occuring at the time of service
